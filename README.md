to setup your pico w first find the 2 front pins on the left of the port and short them by making a wire touch both at the same time and then plug it in while holding the boot button
once it is plugged in it will show up as RDP1orRDP2 copy flashnuke onto it and it will wipe the pico w 
then copy the adafruit file onto it it will reboot and reconnect as circutpy 
delte all the files on circutpy then copy the lib folder on this repository and copy it to that then copy every python files to it once that is done edit the paylaod to do what ever it is you want it to do
once you have made your payload copy it onto the pico w and unplug then dissconnect the wire so its not shorting the pins are your good to go.
to make a new payload follow the steps agian
